# ESPLOATED

Things email service providers do to your code.

## What is it?

A list of things that Email Service Providers do to your HTML code, intentionally or not.

## Why is it?

If your ESP is messing with your HTML code (and you can't do anything about it), it can lead to unexpected results, like broken layouts and poor-performing campaigns.

Email developers like their code untouched. Marketers like their campaigns to perform.

## Who is it for?

Any poor soul interested in these kind of things. Mainly [#emailgeeks](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23emailgeeks).

## Can I help?

Glad you asked!
